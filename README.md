# Smart-Home-
-in this project we used two atmega32 micro controller communicating  with each other using UART which each microcontroller can send signals to the other  
-we can manage that many users can enter the house using their own usernames and passowrds  
-we used LM35 Temperature sensor to control the speed of DC motor using PWM and to open doors in emergency case when there is a fire  
-we used LDR to To control the lighting degree  
-7 segments clock using multiplixed mode  

#Drivers used:  
-MCAL  DIO , TIMERS , External Interrupts , PWM  , UART ,ADC  

-HAL : LCD, seven segments ,  buzzer, LDR, LM35, DC motor, servo motor, Keypad , clock
